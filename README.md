# Take Home Assignment:  
I created a simple login UI for my tests. The 5 tests do simple input validation tests.  

To run these tests, download or clone the repository. 
` git clone https://github.com/priyakumar0817/loginActivitySample `

Go to Android Studio IDE and open the project

1. To build your Android application (APK):  
` ./gradlew assembleDebug `
2. To install and run your Android application on a connected device or emulator:  
`./gradlew installDebug`
3. To run instrumentation tests (Android UI tests):  
`./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest `
4. To clean project:  
`./gradlew clean`

OR, simply press "Run" on Android Studio IDE after connected to an emulator.
